About six years ago, we began an international cooperative journey that, without us fully realizing it at the time, would change the way we see the world. It showed us that technological cooperativism is alive (and beating strongly) in many corners of the planet.

Because yes, there are different languages, impossible time zones, and customs that can feel confusing at first. But beneath all that, when cooperativists meet, a shared language emerges. A simple, almost obvious, yet deeply powerful idea: **no one is saved alone**. And from that idea comes an immediate response: if we want to grow stronger, **the best strategy is to get organized and collaborate**.

## The sixth trip, the same mission: building community

In October of this year, we set out on our sixth international inter-cooperative trip. The goal was clear: to keep building cooperative ties, strengthen relationships based on trust, and sustain, in practice, what we stand for in words.

What followed was one of those experiences that leaves your chest full of enthusiasm.


## First stop: the Basque Country, OGP Summit and connections that multiply

The journey began in the Basque Country, in **Vitoria-Gasteiz**, where we participated in the **OGP Summit**, an event focused on open government and open data. It was one of those moments where you realize you’re not alone in what you think or in what you’re trying to build. We met like-minded organizations, shared ideas, debates and concerns, and also laughter, long conversations over meals, and that beautiful collective energy.

At the Summit we reunited with **Ana Aguirre**, a dear friend who has helped us on several occasions to organize trips and build bridges with organizations that supported the creation of **Patio**, the international network of technology cooperatives that today spans **28 countries** and brings together **more than 150 cooperatives**.

We also had the joy of meeting **Juan and Paul** from **Eraman**, a cooperative that is part of the **CoopCycle** federation. For those unfamiliar, CoopCycle is a cooperative alternative to traditional delivery platforms, a project we worked on for several years, which allowed us to concretely support the platform cooperativism movement and help turn an ideal into real, working infrastructure.

We were also able to meet with members of the **Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN)**, with whom we are working to sign a framework collaboration agreement to continue building technology with values, focusing on institutional transparency and open data.


## Mondragón: a dream fulfilled

While in the Basque Country, we also made our way to **Mondragón**, the largest cooperative corporation in the world. Visiting Mondragón was a dream come true, but it was also something more: clear proof that **cooperativism as a form of organization has no limits of scale**.

> Cooperation doesn’t constrain, it drives, transforms, and strengthens.

We toured the building where they train people who lead the cooperative enterprises of the corporation, talked about innovation and technology, and left with the idea of connecting with the innovation area of the cooperative university they founded, to explore the possibility of bringing them into our community.


## Bulgaria: strategy, friendship… and mate being shared like at home

From the Basque Country we traveled to **Bulgaria**, where our friends from **Camplight** welcomed us and made us feel at home once again. Over **three days of working together**, we thought, debated and designed strategies for the year ahead.

In those encounters, affection and respect blend naturally with work: you plan, discuss ideas, organize priorities, and at the center of it all, what truly sustains everything appears: **friendship**.

As if that weren’t enough, we organized activities to learn negotiation techniques and a quiz about Argentina, with great prizes for the winners.

It was incredible to see how much they knew about Argentine music, slang, geography and customs. One of them even became a fan of cuarteto music and sent us a photo on his way home listening to a song by La Mona. 

To close the quiz, we handed out **Argentina national team jerseys**, with a fantasy that already feels real: that next year, during the World Cup, we’ll have friends in another part of the world cheering for Argentina, wearing the jersey in some small bar in the heart of Bulgaria.

And of course, **mate was circulating as if we were at one of our cooperative assemblies**.


## Sharing culture is also political

I can try to describe all this with words, but some things only truly sink in when they’re lived.

Cooperation didn’t just lead us to share projects and build friendships; it also led us to **share culture, a culture we love and value, with people who embraced it as their own for a few hours**.

In a world where difference so often divides, that is a message as deeply political as it is profoundly beautiful.


## Barcelona: events, community, and a place that inspired us

From Bulgaria we traveled to **Barcelona**, where we took part in two incredible events. But we didn’t go alone: colleagues from **Camplight** and **Nayra** joined us.

And something we love happened: the trip stopped being “ours” and became, once again, a shared journey.

### MozFest

The first event was **MozFest**, organized by the **Mozilla Foundation**, aimed at strengthening its community and spreading its mission among those of us who care about technology built on free software and grounded in autonomous and sovereign principles.

### bloc4: a recovered space

We then visited the most inspiring self-managed cooperative center we’ve encountered so far: **bloc4**, a recovered space where many cooperatives coexist, giving life to an interdisciplinary ecosystem.

> A hub of organizations that once again proves that the cooperative form doesn’t limit scale, it expands it.

## Patio at the center: challenging decisions, big dreams

During our time at bloc4, we discussed key issues related to Patio. From **how to share a common budget** and apply proposals from different parts of the world, to **how to shape Patio’s legal structure** and where its headquarters should be located, an enormous goal, as we never imagined we’d be thinking about founding an international confederation of technology cooperatives.

We also **reviewed progress on the new visual identity and landing page**, and how they can help us communicate better and generate traction among the cooperatives that make up the network.

These kinds of conversations leave you electrified — by their complexity, by the responsibility they imply, but above all by the clear sense that **something real is growing**.

## “Coop & Travel”: something that started as a play on words

We left Barcelona full of enthusiasm. Several years ago, we started playing with a concept we called **“Coop & Travel”**, as a counterpoint to *“Work & Travel”*.

It began as a joke, a wordplay… but we never imagined we’d still be traveling, being hosted by cooperativists in different parts of the world; that we’d become friends; and that we’d be working within a growing network, carrying the banner of collaboration worldwide, in a world that is far from neutral.

And here I want to pause. **The world is in trouble**. Extractive capitalism at its most extreme, wars, competition between powers, geopolitical maneuvers that radicalize thinking and polarize societies. Right-wing movements pushing formulas we already know don’t work, at least not for the majority.

**And in the middle of all that, there’s us. Cooperating. Dreaming of a different kind of construction.**

Sharing mate with a friend from Bulgaria while talking with another friend in Barcelona about how to push forward projects with positive impact that we started with a cooperative in Buenos Aires, without losing the essence: **transparency, democratic organizations, and** that **love for collaboration** that multiplies hands and, at times, **makes borders fade away**.

## If this moves you, come join us

This post is not just a summary of a trip.

**It’s an invitation.**

To meet.

To build networks.

To cooperate even when it seems “easier” to retreat inward.

To build technology (and a future) with values.

Because in the end, we come back to the same idea: **no one is saved alone**. And when we truly cooperate, we don’t just build better projects, we build a world that’s a little more livable.
