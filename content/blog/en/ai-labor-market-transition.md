The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is transforming the labour market at a pace that many workers, organisations, and systems are not yet able to keep up with.

And this is not only about highly repetitive tasks. Regulated or highly specialised professions—such as certified public translators—are already facing structural pressures: AI-assisted tools allow some professionals to significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and shorten delivery times. Those who do not adopt these tools may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, even when their professional expertise remains excellent.

**Workers with long experience and specialised trades face a real risk of being left behind**. Two key issues stand out:

* **Limited or delayed retraining opportunities**: according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), shifting skill demands and the accelerated pace of transformation expose older workers or those with lower levels of digital literacy to a higher risk of skills obsolescence.¹
* **Displacement across sectors**: research from McKinsey & Company shows that many organisations recognise the need to retrain or upskill their workforce, but structural barriers persist (age, skill level, type of trade).²

Not all companies are prepared—or willing—to relocate affected workers in the short term.

Companies operating in highly operational or trade-intensive sectors (manufacturing, transportation, maintenance) face particularly complex reskilling challenges, as McKinsey points out.³

## What Should We Do?

1. **Acknowledge that the impact is not uniform**

Technological transformation does not affect everyone equally. Age, type of trade, access to technology, digital literacy, and organisational culture all influence levels of vulnerability.

2. **Include workers in the transition**

Reskilling cannot be a late reaction to the problem. Continuous training, on-the-job learning, and proactive upskilling programmes must anticipate changes—not arrive when the job is already at risk.

3. **Update labour, educational, and social frameworks**

The scale of the shift requires revisiting public policies and labour models. Debates around shorter workweeks, guaranteed basic income, or large-scale worker relocation programmes are not accidental: they are potential responses to the social impact of automation.

4. **Design multisectoral solutions**

Involving key stakeholders from the outset—workers, companies, governments, and training institutions—is essential for coordinated action.




## Questions to Keep Reflecting On

This process continuously raises new questions and requires us to engage actively in shaping the future of work. Asking the right questions is the first step toward designing solutions that fit our context.

How do we protect those who have valuable trade experience but less access to digital upskilling opportunities?

Which roles will be most affected by AI and automation, and where should we focus our adaptation efforts?

Are we at risk of creating a "two-speed" labour market—one highly automated and another left behind?
