Short Description: We have built a platform for a Canadian company that allows users to book tickets for travels, packages and events.
Long Description: Betterez is a comprehensive platform for bus operators, offering an intuitive booking and ticketing system, plus advanced features like capacity management, connected trips, notifications, loyalty programs, and modern API integrations.

Objective: We contributed to Betterez's transformation, first by helping migrate its monolithic system to a microservices architecture. Years later, we rejoined the development team as Full Stack developers to optimize the system and expand its capabilities.
Contribution:
- Migration from a monolithic system to a microservices platform with a VueJS-based frontend.
- Implementation of a new unified ticket sales flow to enhance user experience.
- Improved bus capacity management by enabling ticket sales for standing passengers.
- Integration with a partner using webhooks to provide sales and demand predictions, displayed in new platform sections.
