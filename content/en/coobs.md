Short Description: A digital platform to track and showcase cooperative actions.
Long Description: COOBS was created to provide internal and external visibility to the cooperative initiatives our organization has carried out since its inception. In response to the need for social balance reporting and structuring annual cooperative activity data, we developed an open-source platform that allows any cooperative to track their initiatives over time and align them with cooperative principles.
Coops: Farox, Nayra, El Maizal
Objective: We built a tool that strengthens the cooperative sector by documenting actions, linking them to cooperative principles, and facilitating the creation of public and accessible social balance reports.
Contribution:
- Research on social balance reports, formats, content, and objectives.
- Formation of a dedicated team to bring the project to life.
- Development of an open-source platform for tracking social actions and generating reports.
- Maintenance of an open-source code repository.
Technologies: Python, Django, VueJS
