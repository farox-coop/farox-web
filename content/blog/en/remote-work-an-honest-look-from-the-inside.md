After years of navigating remote work as a cooperative, we want to share our experience, not from theory, but from what we actually live day to day. Most of our members work 100% remotely (often across different time zones), and all of us contribute to keeping alive the cooperative spirit that brings us together.

## How did we get here?

For us, remote work was neither a strategic decision nor a temporary response to the pandemic or market trends. It was something more organic: an adaptive response to the real lives of the people who are part of our cooperative. **We chose to adapt the structure to people's decisions**, people with personal life projects, with the desire to live in different parts of the country or to pursue different ways of living.

According to the norms and habits of that pre-pandemic moment, when this was considered professionally incompatible, we decided to give it a try.

Remote work thus became the way to continue operating and working together as we always had: by putting people at the center.

## What works: what did we gain?

The transition to fully remote work, of course, brought challenges, but it was also a process of individual and collective growth. Along the way, we encountered several elements that enriched our cooperative:

### Individual freedom, collective commitment

This new reality allowed us to make personal decisions in our lives—distance, personal projects, specific situations—while at the same time strengthening the sense of belonging to a cooperative that supports these processes.

### Diversity of profiles and contexts

Working remotely—geographically and sometimes even temporally, when time zones differ—places Farox members in different "realities": different cities, different rhythms, different ways of organizing the day. **That diversity enriches the perspectives we bring to the cooperative, even though it also challenges us to find ways to come together**.

### Autonomy and trust

Remote work requires an unavoidable foundation of trust: trusting that each person does their part and assumes their role responsibly. We built that foundation over years of working together, of knowing how each person works and what their level of commitment is. Autonomy works when there is prior trust, and that is something we built long before we became geographically dispersed.

### Everyday well-being

This way of organizing work allows us to save time on commuting, on hours lost in traffic, on the daily wear and tear of going back and forth. That recovered time translates into better quality of life, time gained.

## The other side of the coin: negative impacts

Any decision that brings significant change within an organization shakes structures and transforms what was previously considered "normal operations." In Farox's case, implementing a remote setup also brought obstacles and disruptions that are inevitably negative:

### The absence of informal contact

Those hallway conversations, shared lunches, and inside jokes that naturally emerge in in-person work are lost. That social fabric, which used to build itself organically, now has to be created intentionally.

### The risk of isolation

Since most people at Farox work for external clients, and sometimes without direct collaboration with other members, the risk of isolation is real. You can spend weeks focused on your own project without meaningful interaction with your colleagues. **Maintaining a sense of shared purpose requires conscious effort**.

### Communication needs extra muscle

Shared decision-making, which is part of our cooperative DNA, now requires more planning and, in some cases, delegation. What once meant gathering everyone around a table to discuss an issue now requires coordination, a scheduled video call, and prior documentation. Spontaneity is lost, and with it, sometimes, a certain agility.

## What we had to rethink

The transformations our structure went through when we began organizing ourselves under this new model—both positive and negative—led us (and continue to lead us) to reimagine our workspace, our relationships, and the ways we strengthen team decision-making and our cooperative identity.

### Weekly meetings

Since spontaneity was no longer an option, we had to create fixed spaces. One meeting to address day-to-day matters, and another for open use or for deeper discussion of current topics. **Redesigning formats, frequency, and decision-making processes was key**.

### In-person assemblies

We already had semiannual assemblies to address less everyday, more strategic issues, and to define objectives and strategies. Beyond the agenda, these spaces became a tool for generating in-person encounters and reconnecting. Traveling to meet our colleagues twice a year is now part of our cooperative life.

### Tools, delegation, and decision-making methodologies

We had to find new mechanisms that allow everyone to have a voice while ensuring traceability in decisions. One of the major challenges of remote work models is avoiding being "everyone involved in everything," given the exhaustion this creates. This makes delegation essential, along with clear communication.

### The decision-making process

Making important decisions now requires more time, more documentation, and greater clarity in communication. What used to be resolved in a face-to-face conversation now moves through messages, shared documents, and eventually a video call.

One key element was the search for systems or tools—chat channels, email formats, agile voting mechanisms, etc.—that fit our organization's way of working and helped activate these conversations easily, leading to real outcomes.

The process is slower and less agile, but in return it is more traceable and methodical, which has also resulted in professional growth.

Remote work ultimately forced us to be more systematic, to better respect internal processes, and to consciously choose which topics to address at each moment and how to approach them.

## The organization that sustains remote work

One of the most important lessons we learned in this process is that **remote work does not function on its own**. It requires organization and agreements to sustain it.

We need rituals that reduce distance: regular meetings, internal working teams, clear decision-making instances, moments of social connection. We need communication and collaboration tools, and agreements on how we use them. We need to document more, **make explicit what was once implicit**, and create structures where informality used to be enough.

Remote work in a cooperative is not simply "working from home." It is an organizational form that requires intention, design, and constant maintenance. Without that, **geographic dispersion can turn into dispersion of the project itself**.

## Moving forward

Our advantage lies in our shared history. **Years of working together have built a foundation of trust that sustains us**. But it is also our responsibility not to take it for granted. Remote work forces us to be more intentional: in how we communicate, how we make decisions, and how we keep the cooperative project alive despite the distance.

We do not have all the answers or magic formulas. But asking these questions, sharing these tensions, and putting them on the table is the path we have chosen at Farox to move forward. **Growing as a group also means accepting change and understanding that some things simply cannot be replaced**. We have learned—and continue to learn—how to navigate distance, embrace what works, and keep building despite the challenges it presents.
