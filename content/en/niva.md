Short Description: We automate data collection and validation processes for organisations by applying our Machine Learning skills.
Long Description: Niva is a startup that created a platform to simplify business identity verification (KYB - Know Your Business) using AI to extract, verify, and validate information from official documents in the shortest time possible.
Objective: Our goal in participating in the project was to contribute our expertise in using AI (mainly LLMs, but also visual recognition tools) for extracting information from official company documents, ensuring proper interpretation and validation.
Contribution:
- Definition of core platform features, testing mechanisms for LLM tasks, and exploration of AI tools aligned with business needs.
- Adaptation of the document processing flow to support different user types, as each business has specific documents that demonstrate the company's validity.
